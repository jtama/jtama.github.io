You work with a complex maven project. That's a fact, otherwise you wouldn't be here, searching to uncover a way out of its dependencies maze.

Your project probably has a `parent`, as your `parent` might also have one.

You may have `boms` in your dependency management, but your `parent` certainly has one too.

You defined `properties`, and guess what, so have at least a dozen direct or transitive dependencies.

So after having done your research, not relying on some gibberish from whatever AI assistant you usually use, you found out about :

[source,console]
----
mvn dependency:tree
----


While that does give you a nice console output, chances are it's not enough. Again, you wouldn't be here if it was.

It does tell you the dependency version used, where they were pulled out from, but why that specific version was used can still be unclear.

Let's say you have a dependency somewhere in you project hierarchy defined as followed:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
  <version>$\{spring.boot.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

The property value is defined to be `3.4.4` in your parent, but the the `dependency:tree` plugin output tells you the value is `2.7.9`, and so you rightfully ask yourself, why the f... is that.

Well it just happens that this can be easily solved using the `help` plugin:

[source,console]
----
mvn help:effective-pom -Dverbose=true
----

It will spit out your pom as seen by the great `maven` itself. The only issue is that chances are great that your console buffer will be  overflowed. But we are smarter than that.

[source,console]
----
mvn help:effective-pom -Dverbose=true | grep spring.boot.version
----

It will give you something like :

[source,console]
----
 <spring.boot.version>2.7.9</spring.boot.version>  \
    <!-- com.acme:your.exotic.dependency:17.0.18-RC3-FINAL-GA, line 253 -->

----

There! You have it! Of course your exotic dependency is the culprit. Now that you know it, it will be much easier to fix. Don't you think ?
