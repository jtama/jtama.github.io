icon:skull[*4] _Opinions are my own. I may have to exagerate them for obvious narrative reasons._

Yes, you hate *Markdown*, and yet it seems to spread like a disease.

Yet, textual format documentation is an absolute necessity for us developers, and I am sure you already have found your challenger. I am talking, of course, about *ASCIIDOC*

Guess you would not be here if you hadn't.

But there are some cases where you just don't have a choice and have to produce *Markdown*. 😢

== You are not doomed.

It seems that https://github.com/mojavelinux[Dan Allen], father of https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor], agrees with you 100%.

Strange, isn't it?

Anyway, he also fathered https://github.com/opendevise/downdoc[Downdoc]... That name is absolutely marvelous, and here is its headline:

> Rapidly down-converts AsciiDoc to Markdown.

You can either use _npx_ to use it :

[source,shell]
----
npx downdoc -o out.md README.adoc
----

Or install it using https://mise.jdx.dev/[mise]:

[source,shell]
----
mise use npm:downdoc@latest
downdoc -v
----

=== All hail to _ASCIIDOC_
