== But why?

Why a car? Because it’s a custom one.

Now that we have answered this crucial question, let’s push it aside and move on. icon:tractor[]

== No I meant why a custom section helper?

Ohhhhh. Ok.
Sometimes you need to execute code to generate content, not just compose templating bits.

To do this _Qute_ lets you define custom section helper that allows java code execution, to transform content. Here are some existing section helpers :

[HORIZONTAL]
Mardown/Asciidoc:: They will generate HTML content from doc-as-code content
QRCode:: That will generate an image based on a given _URL_

== What will we do?

In this blog post, we will implement a custom section helper that allows to invoke a https://kroki.io[**Kroki.io**] server to generate images from almost every possible diagram as code language.

What I'd like to have is a simple and common way for the user to let us know that he is writing a diagram and would like us to generate the rendering for him.

Something like :

[source, asciidoc]
....
----
title: A blog post with a diagram
tags: qute,diagram
----

Here's my blog post:

++++ <1>
\{#diagram language="dbml" outputFormat="svg" alt="Blog tables diagram" width=400 height=500}
@startuml
!theme hacker

left to right direction

object users {
id : integer
username : varchar
role : varchar
created_at : timestamp
}

object posts {
id : integer [primary key]
title : varchar
body : text
user_id : integer
status : post_status
created_at : timestamp
}

note left: **body** => Content of the post

enum post_status {
draft
published
private
}

note right of post_status: **private** => visible via URL only

posts::user_id --> users::id
posts::post_status --> post_status

@enduml
\{/}

++++
....
<1> Just to tell the asciidoc engine it's a passthrough

And I would like to be automatically converted to :

++++
{#diagram language="plantuml" diagramOutputFormat="svg" alt="Blog tables diagram" width=600 height=400}

@startuml
!theme hacker

left to right direction

object users {
     id : integer
     username : varchar
     role : varchar
     created_at : timestamp
}

object posts {
     id : integer [primary key]
     title : varchar
     body : text
     user_id : integer
     status : post_status
     created_at : timestamp
}

note left: **body** => Content of the post

enum post_status {
    draft
    published
    private
}

note right of post_status: **private** => visible via URL only

posts::user_id --> users::id
posts::post_status --> post_status

@enduml
{/}

++++

== Let's implement this

If you try the above code right now, Roq will bark that no section helper is available to process this section.

Let's fix this. We will just create a new `SectionHelper` and its corresponding `factory`, usually declared in a single source file

[source,java]
----
import io.quarkus.qute.EngineConfiguration;
import io.quarkus.qute.ResultNode;
import io.quarkus.qute.SectionHelper;
import io.quarkus.qute.SectionHelperFactory;

import java.util.List;
import java.util.concurrent.CompletionStage;

@EngineConfiguration <1>
public class DiagramsSectionHelperFactory implements SectionHelperFactory<DiagramsSectionHelperFactory.DiagramSectionHelper> {

    @Override
    public List<String> getDefaultAliases() {
        return List.of("diagrams"); <2>
    }

    @Override
    public DiagramSectionHelper initialize(SectionInitContext context) { <3>
        new DiagramSectionHelper(context);
    }

    public class DiagramSectionHelper implements SectionHelper {
        @Override
        public CompletionStage<ResultNode> resolve(SectionResolutionContext context) {
            return context.execute(); <4>
        }
    }
}

----
<1> This annotation tells the _**Qute**_ engine that this instance is here for him. Namely that he must register a new section helper.
<2> Here is our new section alias
<3> Where we can initialize an helper for this specific resolution context
<4> Returns exactly what was given in.


For the moment, that's not much better, the content of the section is rendered untouched, but at least, it doesn't bark at us anymore.

I will spare you the **Kroki.io** client implementation details, but let's just say we have the following interface:

[source,java]
----
public interface DiagramConverter {

    String encode(String diagramSource, DiagramParams params); <1>

    record DiagramParams(String diagramLanguage, String alt, Integer width, Integer height, DiagramConverter.DiagramOutputFormat diagramOutputFormat) {

        }
}
----
<1> Generates the needed `HTML` code to display the diagram using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme[the data uri scheme]

=== Let's dive a bit more

They are a few more methods available in the `DiagramsSectionHelperFactory`. Let's take a closer look at the `initialize` one.
For the sake of brevity, the code pretends there is only the single _language_ parameter to deal with  :

[source,java]
----
public class DiagramsSectionHelperFactory implements SectionHelperFactory<DiagramsSectionHelperFactory.DiagramSectionHelper> {

    private DiagramConverter converter;

    //more code here

    @Override
    public DiagramSectionHelper initialize(SectionInitContext context) {
        String diagramLanguage = context.getParameter("language"); <1>
        new DiagramSectionHelper(language, converter);
    }

    //and more here
}
----
<1> Gets the language param value. Be aware that it will always be a `String`, so you may have to do conversions if needed

[IMPORTANT]
====
Should you need to use expressions instead of literals as value, you would need a more convoluted path. That would not bite you though. Let me know if you are interested.
====

== That's it we are done!

Adding a new `SectionHelper` is not hard. Of course this sample is naive, and the complexity hidden in the converter. But I am sure you can foresee useful use cases for them. Everything I've just shown is available with https://quarkus.io[_Quarkus_] and https://quarkus.io/guides/qute[_Qute_] only.
